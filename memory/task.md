## Phase 7: Competency Engine & Skill Gap Analysis
- [x] Skills CRUD (admin-managed, read-accessible to all)
- [x] Competency CRUD with skill-linking
- [x] Trainee competency upsert (currentLevel / requiredLevel / targetLevel)
- [x] Gap calculator: `gapValue = max(0, requiredLevel - currentLevel)` → persisted as `SkillGapAnalysis` row
- [x] Classification: none(0) / low(1) / medium(2) / high(3) / critical(4+)

- [x] Admin/Trainer: view any trainee's gap report
- [x] Org competency heatmap

## Phase 8: Trainer Matching Engine
- [x] Multi-signal scoring algorithm (6 weighted factors: skill overlap 35%, proficiency delta 20%, availability 15%, experience 10%, rating 10%, certification 10%)
- [x] Trainee-to-trainer matching: collects gap skills → scores all verified trainers → persists ranked results
- [x] Course-to-trainer matching: scores trainers against a course's skill requirements
- [x] Cached match retrieval endpoint
- [x] Admin endpoint: compute matches for any trainee
- [x] Human-readable `reasons` JSON persisted with each match score
- [x] Full score `breakdown` returned per trainer in API response

## Phase 14: Seed Realistic Data
- [x] Seed script for demo data (`packages/db/prisma/seed.ts`)
- [x] Seeded Departments, Admin, Trainers, Trainees, Courses, MCQs, Certificates, and Audit Logs

## Phase 15: Testing, Bug Identification & Fixing

- [ ] Triage and fix failures

## Phase 16: Final Production-Readiness Review
- [ ] Verify secrets, RBAC, docs
- [ ] Produce `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
